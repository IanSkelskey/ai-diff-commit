# AI Diff Commit

Automates the creation of standardized Git commit messages using [OpenAI's API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/), ensuring adherence to the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for clear and meaningful commit history.

## Features

- **Automated Commit Messages**: Generate standardized commit messages based on the changes in your repository.
- **Conventional Commits**: Ensure that your commit messages adhere to the Conventional Commits specification.
- **Customizable Commit Messages**: Modify the generated commit message to suit your needs before committing the changes.
- **Automated Git Operations**: Automatically add, commit, and push the changes to your repository.

## Limitations

- **OpenAI API Key**: Requires an API key from OpenAI to access the GPT-3 model for generating commit messages.
- **Internet Connection**: Requires an active internet connection to communicate with the OpenAI API.
- **Always Adds All Changes**: Adds all changes in the repository to the commit, which may not be suitable for all scenarios.
- **Requires a Git Repository**: Needs to be run in a Git repository to access the changes for generating commit messages.

## Installation Instructions (Windows)

I have only tested this on Windows, but it should work on other operating systems with minor modifications. For now, I will provide instructions for setting up the script on Windows that worked for me.

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Add an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key as the value. This is required to access the GPT model for generating commit messages.
4. Move the repository contents to wherever to store scripts. I used `C:\Scripts` for this example.
5. Add the path to the `C:\Scripts` directory to your system's PATH environment variable.
6. Create a `ai_diff_commit.bat` file in the `C:\Scripts` directory with the following content:
    ```batch
    @echo off
    python C:\Scripts\ai_diff_commit\src\ai_diff_commit.py %*
    ```
7. Now you can run the `ai_diff_commit` command from any directory to generate commit messages based on the changes in your repository.

## Usage Instructions (Windows)

Once you have set up the script using the installation instructions, you can use the `ai_diff_commit` command to generate commit messages based on the changes in your repository.

### Flags

- `-p`, `--push`: Automatically push the changes to the remote repository after committing.

## Example Output

Here is an example of the output generated by the script. This commit message was created based on the changes in the README that you are currently reading.

docs: enhance README with detailed instructions and features

Expanded the README file to include detailed information about the features and limitations of the AI Diff Commit tool. It now provides a comprehensive guide on how to set up and use the tool effectively.

Changes include:
- Added a `Features` section highlighting key capabilities such as automated commit messages, adherence to Conventional Commits, customization options, and automated Git operations.
- Described the `Limitations` of the tool including the need for an OpenAI API key, active internet connection, behavior of adding all changes, and the necessity of a Git repository.
- Provided `Usage Instructions (Windows)` detailing steps to configure the tool on Windows platforms, from cloning the repository to setting up the OpenAI API key and creating a batch file for easy command execution.

This update aims to make the tool more accessible and easier to integrate into existing workflows, ensuring users have all the necessary information to get started.
